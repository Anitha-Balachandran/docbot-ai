# Chat with PDF using Groq and OpenAI Embeddings

## Project Summary

This project allows users to upload PDF files, interact with them, and ask questions based on the content using Groq Cloud and OpenAI embeddings. The system utilizes Groq Cloud's powerful language models to generate insightful answers from the documents, making it an efficient tool for research, learning, and knowledge extraction. The project is built using Streamlit for the frontend, allowing a seamless user experience for file uploading, model selection, and question querying.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) for document processing and question answering.
- **Groq Cloud**: Cloud-based machine learning models for efficient processing and reasoning with large datasets.
- **OpenAI**: Embedding models used for vectorization of the text data.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
